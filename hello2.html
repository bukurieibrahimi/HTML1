<h3>Mathematic</h3>
<p>
    From <i>Wikipedia</i>, the free encyclopedia
   
    
<br> <br><b> Mathematics</b> (from <b><i> Ancient Greek</i></b>  μάθημα; máthēma: 'knowledge, study, learning') is an area of knowledge that includes such topics as numbers (arithmetic and number theory),[1] formulas and related structures (algebra),[2] shapes and the spaces in which they are contained (geometry),[1] and quantities and their changes (calculus and analysis).[3][4][5] Most mathematical activity involves the use of pure reason to discover or prove the properties of abstract objects, which consist of either abstractions from nature or—in modern mathematics—entities that are stipulated with certain properties, called axioms. A mathematical proof consists of a succession of applications of some deductive rules to already known results, including previously proved theorems,
     axioms and (in case of abstraction from nature) some basic properties that are considered as true starting points of the theory under consideration.

   <b>Number theorists </b> study <abbr title ="prime numbers">PR</abbr> as well as the properties of mathematical objects made out of integers
     (for example, rational numbers) or defined as generalizations of the integers (for example, algebraic integers).
